## Instructions:
I have used Python 3.11 for this task.

Create .env file in the root folder in which you will store sensitive information and configurations.

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=

DATA_PATH='data'
CLOUDFORMATION_TEMPLATE_PATH='template.yaml'
STACK_NAME='cloudformationstack'
JOB_NAME='glueETLjob'
SCRIPT_FILE_PATH='script.py'

SECRET_NAME='redshift_credentials'
DW_USER=
DW_PASS=
DW_DB='dev'
DW_HOST=
DW_PORT='5439'
DW_ENGINE='redshift'
```

Make sure you have installed all the library dependencies of the main.py script by executing:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to import the data into a Data Warehouse you have to run the main.py script and this will automatically create a Cloudformation Stack with the required resources. After that boto3 is used to populate the S3 buckets and run Glue Crawler and Glue ETL in the correct order to ingest data in the Data Warehouse tables.

## Note:
The table schemas are mentioned in the Glue ETL script (script.py)

## Test:
A simple validation testing case has been added that compares the count of the items in the CSV files & in Redshift. This is a simple assertion that should provide some confidence that the files were loaded properly from the Glue Crawler and then Glue ETL loaded them correctly in Redshift tables

## Next Steps:
- Clean CSVs to have consistent data and the right header to be used for the column names, Try having a custom Classifier for the Glue Crawler to parse all the CSVs correctly.
- Investigate: The costs.csv file didnâ€™t parse correctly by the glue crawler but for some reason in the redshift table the data are coming for these columns
- Parse schema from glue data catalog dynamically while ingesting CSVs from S3 to Redshift
- Make sure the glue crawler have the correct rules for expected data to convert them into the right data type (dates especially)
- Check the Status of the Glue Crawler's last run to reduce the time the script is waiting for the crawling to be over.

## Issues with current implementation
Glue crawler doesn't recognize the header for Country_Table.csv and Customer_Table.csv that's why the assertion of the count comparing test skips those two tables
